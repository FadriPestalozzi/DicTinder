*Igniting your most dangerous love affair*

Tinder for dictators - Explosive satire üí•


# üé≠ Concept


DicTinder is a dark comedy dating app satire that plays on the double entendre of "dic" (dictator and dick). The concept revolves around the humorous observation that dictators tend to have small... egos... and compensate by being even greater jerks in their terrible behavior towards fellow humans.
